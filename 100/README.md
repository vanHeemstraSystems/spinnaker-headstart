# 100 - Introduction

We will install Spinnaker on Lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) for proofs of concept, see the open source project [minnaker](https://github.com/armory/minnaker). We can install Spinnaker in about 10 minutes in a local or cloud VM. We will attempt to install it as a Docker Container to be hosted on a VM.

Based on "Spinnaker All-In-One (Minnaker) Quick Start" at https://github.com/armory/minnaker
